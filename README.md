# Peepr

Just me experiementing with Rails and the Twitter client. Features:

* Logging into Twitter via OAuth
* Reading tweets from your timeline
* Posting to Twitter as the logged in account

You can see it in action at:

To run locally, you'll need to register an app on https://apps.twitter.com/ and set the following:

    export API_KEY=your_app_key
    export API_SECRET=your_app_secret

### Why all the Petri stuff?

That's the name of my bird. The name makes sense, since the little guy is more dangerous than he looks.
